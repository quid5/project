## About
This repository contains a sample application project built on top of the QuidPHP frameword. This application is using LemurCms for content management. It also offers a way to run the full QuidPHP test suite.

## License
**QuidPHP/Project** is available as an open-source software under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

## Documentation
**QuidPHP/Project** documentation is being written. Once ready, it will be available at https://quidphp.github.io/project.

## Installation
**QuidPHP/Project** can be easily installed with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org). It is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/quidphp/project).
``` bash
$ composer create-project quidphp/project --prefer-dist
```

Once this is complete, simply follow these steps:
1. Make sure the [storage](storage) and [public](public) folders are writable by your web server. For [storage](storage) also make sure all subdirectories are writable.
2. Configure an Apache Virtual Host or Nginx Server Block in order to have a domain pointing to the [public](public) folder document root.
3. Import [sql/project.sql.zip](sql/project.sql.zip) within a new Mysql/MariaDB database.
4. Duplicate the [env-default.php](env-default.php) file and rename it to **env.php**.
5. Update the scheme hosts within the **env.php** file. You will need to set a different host (domain or subdomain) for the application and the CMS.
6. Update the database parameters within the **env.php** file.
7. Not required, but you are encouraged to change the namespace of all PHP classes within the [src](src) folder. The default namespace is Project.

## Booting
There are two ways to boot the application or CMS.

### HTTP
From your web browser, enter the URL to the [public/index.php](public/index.php) entry file. The host used will determine if the application or CMS is used.

### CLI
Open the project folder in the application. The entry should be in the following format: **php quid [path][:envType]**. If the *envType* is not specified, the system will use the *cliEnvType* value within the **env.php** file. Exemple:
``` bash
$ php quid /fr/my-url
$ php quid /:dev/cms
$ php quid /:dev/assert
```

1. Import [sql/test.sql.zip](sql/test.sql.zip) within a new Mysql/MariaDB database.
2. Update the database parameters within the **env.php** file (look at @assert).
3. Update the scheme hosts within the **env.php** file (dev/assert or prod/assert).
4. From your web browser, enter the URL to the [public/test.php](public/test.php) entry file.

### Known issues
- On some setup, you may need to add your domain to the system hosts file. If not, some assertions involving curl may fail.
- On Windows, you will need to add *lower_case_table_names* = 2 in your database configuration file (my.cnf). The table and column names need to be stored in their natural case.
